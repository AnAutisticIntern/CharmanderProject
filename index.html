                <p>
                    Charmander (/ˈtʃɑːrmændər/), known as Hitokage (ヒトカゲ) in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo's
                    and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Atsuko Nishida,[1] Charmander first appeared in the
                    video games Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise,
                    spinoff titles, and various movies, animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The end of a
                    Charmander's tail is alight with a flame, and the flame's size reflects both the physical health and
                    the emotions of the individual. It is known as the Lizard Pokemon.<br><br>

                    Charmander is one of three 'starter' Pokémon that can be selected at the beginning of Pokémon Red
                    and Blue, and their remakes, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. The other two starters are Bulbasaur and
                    Squirtle. In the anime, Ash acquires a Charmander early in the series, and it became one of his most
                    used Pokémon. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather
                    Professor Oak. Since it appeared in the Pokémon series, Charmander has received generally positive
                    reception. Charmander first appeared in episode 11 of Pokémon Indigo League ("Charmander – The Stray
                    Pokémon" (The Stray Pokémon – Hitokage)). In the episode, Charmander is left by its owner, Damian,
                    and is rescued by Ash and Brock. When Damian sees how powerful Charmander is, he calls Charmander
                    back. However, because of Damian's abuse, Charmander chooses to follow the group that saved its
                    life, and becomes Ash's Pokémon. In the series, the narrator stated that if a Charmander's tail
                    flame goes out, it dies. Charmander is used by Ash throughout his adventures and is seen in special
                    episodes in the future. <br><br>

                    Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16, who then evolves into Charizard at level 36, which
                    was originally its last form. Since the release of Pokémon X and Y, Charizard can mega evolve into 2
                    different types of Mega Charizard, which are Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y, for the duration
                    of a battle. This gives it temporary upgraded stats and a major damage bonus. Charmander is a stray
                    Pokémon.
